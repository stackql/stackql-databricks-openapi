GET
/api/2.0/accounts/{account_id}/settings/types/shield_csp_enablement_ac/names/default
Gets the compliance security profile setting for new workspaces.
Path parameters
code: account_id
required
string
Query parameters
code: etag
string
etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag
provided. This is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to
help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting each other. It
is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read ->
delete pattern to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race
conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET request, and pass it with the
DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.

This is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous

order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET request, and pass it
with the PATCH request to identify the setting version you are updating.
code: setting_name
string
Name of the corresponding setting. This field is populated in the response, but it will not be respected
