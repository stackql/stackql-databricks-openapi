PATCH
/api/2.0/accounts/{account_id}/settings/types/shield_esm_enablement_ac/names/default
Updates the value of the enhanced security monitoring setting for new workspaces.
Path parameters
code: account_id
required
uuid
Databricks account ID of the account being managed.
Request body
Details required to update a setting.
code: allow_missing
required
boolean
This should always be set to true for Settings API. Added for AIP compliance.
code: setting
object
code: etag
string
etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided.
This is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous
writes of a setting overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems
make use of the etag in the read -> update pattern to perform setting updates in
order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET request, and pass it
with the PATCH request to identify the setting version you are updating.
code: setting_name
string
Name of the corresponding setting. This field is populated in the response, but it will not be respected
even if it's set in the request body. The setting name in the path parameter will be
respected instead. Setting name is required to be 'default' if the setting only has one instance per workspace.
code: esm_enablement_account
required
object
Account level policy for ESM
code: field_mask
required
string
Field mask is required to be passed into the PATCH request. Field mask specifies which fields
of the setting payload will be updated.
The field mask needs to be supplied as single string. To specify multiple fields in the field mask,
use comma as the separator (no space).
