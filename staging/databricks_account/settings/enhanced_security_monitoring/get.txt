GET
/api/2.0/accounts/{account_id}/settings/types/shield_esm_enablement_ac/names/default
Gets the enhanced security monitoring setting for new workspaces.
Path parameters
code: account_id
required
string
Query parameters
code: etag
string
etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag
provided. This is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to
help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting each other. It
is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read ->
delete pattern to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race
conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET request, and pass it with the
DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.

This is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous
writes of a setting overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems
make use of the etag in the read -> update pattern to perform setting updates in
order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET request, and pass it
with the PATCH request to identify the setting version you are updating.
code: setting_name
string
Name of the corresponding setting. This field is populated in the response, but it will not be respected
even if it's set in the request body. The setting name in the path parameter will be
respected instead. Setting name is required to be 'default' if the setting only has one instance per workspace.
code: esm_enablement_account
required
