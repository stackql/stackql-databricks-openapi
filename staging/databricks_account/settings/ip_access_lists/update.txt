PATCH
/api/2.0/accounts/{account_id}/ip-access-lists/{ip_access_list_id}
Updates an existing IP access list, specified by its ID.
A list can include allow lists and block lists. See the top of this file for a description
of how the server treats allow lists and block lists at run time.
When updating an IP access list:
For all allow lists and block lists combined, the API supports a maximum of 1000
IP/CIDR values, where one CIDR counts as a single value. Attempts to exceed that number
return error 400 with
code: error_code
value
code: QUOTA_EXCEEDED
.
If the updated list would block the calling user's current IP, error 400 is returned
with
code: error_code
value
code: INVALID_STATE
.
It can take a few minutes for the changes to take effect.
