POST
/api/2.0/accounts/{account_id}/ip-access-lists
Creates an IP access list for the account.
A list can be an allow list or a block list. See the top of this file for a description of
how the server treats allow lists and block lists at runtime.
When creating or updating an IP access list:
For all allow lists and block lists combined, the API supports a maximum of 1000
IP/CIDR values, where one CIDR counts as a single value. Attempts to exceed that number
return error 400 with
code: error_code
value
code: QUOTA_EXCEEDED
.
If the new list would block the calling user's current IP, error 400 is returned with
code: error_code
value
code: INVALID_STATE
.
It can take a few minutes for the changes to take effect.
