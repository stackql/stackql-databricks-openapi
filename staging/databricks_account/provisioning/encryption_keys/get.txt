GET
/api/2.0/accounts/{account_id}/customer-managed-keys/{customer_managed_key_id}
Gets a customer-managed key configuration object for an account, specified by ID.
This operation uploads a reference to a customer-managed key to Databricks.
If assigned as a workspace's customer-managed key for managed services, Databricks uses the
key to encrypt the workspaces notebooks and secrets in the control plane, in addition to
Databricks SQL queries and query history. If it is specified as a workspace's
customer-managed key for storage, the key encrypts the workspace's root S3 bucket
(which contains the workspace's root DBFS and system data) and, optionally, cluster EBS volume data.
Important
: Customer-managed keys are supported only for some deployment types,
subscription types, and AWS regions.
This operation is available only if your account is on the E2 version of the platform.",
