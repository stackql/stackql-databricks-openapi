This is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> delete pattern to perform setting deletions in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET request, and pass it with the DELETE request to identify the rule set version you are deleting.",
